# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.

This is one of the course projects of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree and the main bulk of the code should be tested on AWS Sagemaker's notebook environment.
